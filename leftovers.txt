On the one hand, simplifying data entry points to markdown. Markdown content 
is simple to write, can be converted into styled html, and can also be sanitized 
for security purposes. However, the converted output is text-based and static.

On the other hand, making for a rich user experience points to javascript. Javascript
can generate responsive and interactive content, for example through charts. However, 
running user-generated javascript on a website can be a security risk. 
Also, user-generated javascript is undesirable as it mixes code (*how* to present) 
with content (*what* to present).
